The core logic & type defnitions of [TextPlace](https://t.me/s/gotextplace).

This is written in TypeScript and should be able to run on browsers (web app
uses it), Cloudflare Workers (that TextPlace backend runs on) and Deno (for
development & main test platform). Compatibility with Node.js and Bun is not
guranteed but issues & PRs are welcome.

This is available on both [JSR](https://jsr.io/@textplace/core) and
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@textplace/core). It's published on JSR as
long as the tests are passing, and only published to NPM when a new release is
tagged.
